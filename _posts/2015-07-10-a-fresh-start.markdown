A month ago I decided to become a freelancer. After spending 2 years in a company in Manila, I have had a great time learning all sorts of technology but mainly [Ruby on Rails][ror] and [AngularJS][angular]. Thanks to my seniors and colleagues for unselfishly sharing all knowledge and resources. This really made me a competent programmer.

I guess itâ€™s a fresh start for me and this blog. I will be posting my learnings and ideas here, maybe lots of *AngularJS or Ruby on Rails*, who knows.

[angular]: https://angularjs.org/
