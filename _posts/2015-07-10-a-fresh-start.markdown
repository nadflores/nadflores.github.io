A month ago I decided to become a freelancer. After spending 2 years in a company in Manila, I have had a great time learning all sorts of technology but mainly Ruby on Rails. Thanks to my seniors and colleagues for unselfishly sharing all knowledge and resources. This really made me a competent programmer.

I heard all about freelancing perks such time freedom and picking your own project. This is great if you have clients to work with, but for starters like me I guess it’s a gamble. With all the talented coders out there not to mention their years of experience being a freelancer with portfolios to show off, it’s really hard to compete and bid for projects.

Luckily, a client of my former company decided to hire me as a freelance/contractor. Thanks to my former boss for allowing me to engage directly. So I guess it’s no luck, but I call it God’s grace.

Nevertheless, I guess it’s a fresh start for me and this blog. I will be posting my learnings here, maybe lots of ***AngularJS or Ruby on Rails***, who knows.
