Hi there! I am a web developer living in the Philippines. I grew up in a small island in the province and now I work here remotely from home. I love spending time with my wife after a long day of coding.

I really love to code. I actually taught myself how to write code but mostly I learned from reading otherâ€™s work.

I also play acoustic guitar and love to hear all sorts of acoustic instrumentals.
