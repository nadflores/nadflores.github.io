Hi there! I am a web developer living in the Philippines. I grew up in a small island in the province and now I work here remotely from home. I love spending time with my wife after a long day of coding.

I really love to code. I actually taught myself how to write code but mostly I learned from reading otherâ€™s work.


Currently, I am the lead AngularJS developer of [DrWealth][drwealth] - an online financial planning, portfolio and management application based from Singapore. And I am working on a 2.0 version of the app which will be released later this year.

I also play acoustic guitar and love to hear all sorts of acoustic instrumentals.
